                <p>My name is Holden Looney, obviously. I am a student at the University of Missouri going for my bachelors in Information Technology.</p>
                <p>I started out at Mizzou as a Secondary Education for Biology major and swapped majors five semesters in.</p>
                <h3 color="black">Where I'm From</h3>
                <p>I hail fom the Lake of the Ozarks, more specifically Camdenton.</p>

                <p>
                    Camdenton and Lake are an amazing area to grow up in. I loved it. I never realized how fortunate I was to live there until I left. It's a gorgeous area. 
                    The Lake is magnificent, albeit a little dirty. There's also Ha Ha Tonka which is just truly amazing. I have a lot of fond memories of the place and the views it hosts.
                    Surrounding the Lake is a system of phenomenal rivers and streams, perfect for kayaking, fishing, and swimming.
                    If you're fortunate to have a bit of land there's you'd be hosting all kinds of critters, most noteably the whitetail. They don't get very big but by golly they are tasty.

                <h3 color="black">My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    My main form of recreation right now is definitely video games. My current rotation is Hunt: Showdown, CSGO, Minecraft, and Rocket League.
                    Additionally, I am an avid disc golfer. I picked up the hobby in high school and haven't been able to stop since. Even managed to drag my friends into it.
                    I really love to cook, it's a great stress reliever for me and it's always nice to sit down to a meal you're proud of.
                    I used to hunt, fish, and hike like a maniac in high school. Since then I have drifted away from those hobbies due to there no longer being an ease of access. I do really look forward to returning to those hobbies though, I find them all very fun and rewarding.
                    Here lately, I have been trying to pick up the habit of reading. It seems hard to find the time, but when I do I have a great time. I'm currently reading "Peak Mind" by Amisha Jha.
